UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a front-end for iptables and is used to configure firewall rules on Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. Here are the steps to configure UFW and open ports 22, 443, and 80:

1. Install UFW if it is not already installed:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ufw

2. Set the default policy to deny incoming traffic:

sudo ufw default deny incoming

3. Set the default policy to allow outgoing traffic:

sudo ufw default allow outgoing

4. Allow incoming SSH traffic on port 22:

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

5. Allow incoming HTTPS traffic on port 443:

sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

6. Allow incoming HTTP traffic on port 80:

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

7. Enable UFW:

sudo ufw enable

8. Check the status of UFW:

sudo ufw status


After following these steps, UFW will be configured to allow incoming traffic on ports 22, 443, and 80.
